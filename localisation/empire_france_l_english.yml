france.3.t:0 "Huguenot terrorists destroy manufactry"

france.5.t:0 "France proposes economic integration."

Seeing the dire state of the Spanish economy, the French propose closer economic integration in a personal union between our realms. Whilst this will greatly boost our industrial capacity, experts warn us this may imply a loss of sovereignty and eventually turn us in a French vassal state."
france.5.a:0 "We graciously accept their proposal."
france.5.b:0 "We must refuse."
france.6.t:0 "Spain accepts economic integration"

france.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] denies our demands"
france.13.d:0 "Foolishly, the government of [From.GetNameDefCap] has denied our request. It would appear they would have war instead."

The Aragonese nobility has already expressed a willingness to co-operate, so the choice is up to his majesty. "
france.14.a:0 "An excellent suggestion! Install the regime!"
france.14.b:0 "No, direct control over the region is preferable."
