Whilst we are definitly no friends of the Russians, it is without a doubt that breaking the established truce between ourselves and the Russians may have severe repercussions, not to mention the gravity of the potential loss of life. On the other hand, if Russia would defeat its northern rival, they will be able to divert all their power to the southern front, threatening our highly disputed possessions in the Crimea.
