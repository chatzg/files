poland.2.t:0 "The Question of Absolutism in the Commonwealth"
poland.2.d:0 "Despite not receiving the most votes, August II ‘the Strong’ was elected king of Poland in 1697 with the backing of Russia and Austria, succeeding the late king and hero Jan III Sobieski. An ambitious king, August has sought to bring order to the chaotic political landscape in Poland. Whilst most European nations had become more centralized over the past few decades, Poland had made a turn in the other direction, becoming more decentralized instead.\n \nThe Sejm, the Polish parliament, consists of the most powerful nobles or ‘szlachta’ who dominate the country. Whenever a decision has to be taken, the parliament must unanimously agree with the act. Since every member of the Sejm has a veto, this practically paralyses the country. This is why August has undertaken steps to reform the decentralized government form. He has however run into great complications as his ambitions met the boundaries of reality.\n \nAugust is confronted with what is perhaps the most difficult task in his life. If he is to realise his ambitions to establish a hereditary line of succession and rule with absolute power, he will have to play his cards wisely. "
poland.2.a:0 "Let us push for reform!"
poland.3.t:0 "Question of Nobles privilege"
poland.3.d:0 "August’s ambition to reform the political system of Poland has caused widespread suspicion among the Szlachta class. Especially August’s proposal to get rid of the Liberum Veto, the privilege granting all magnates in the Sejm a veto, has displeased the nobles deeply."
poland.3.a:0 "The opinion of the nobility is of no concern."
poland.3.b:0 "Promise them economic compensation."
poland.3.c:0 "Slow down on the reforms."
poland.4.t:0 "Nobles are angered"
poland.4.d:0 "August’s disregard for the privileges of the Szlachta has sparked widespread unrest among the noble class. Whilst some openly demand the king to change his mind about his plans, others even whisper of an armed revolt.\n \nOne notable figure, prince Franciszek Lubomirski has launched a petition amongst the other szlachta, demanding that the king either retracts his proposals or abdicates."
poland.4.a:0 "Order the execution of Lubomirski "
poland.4.b:0 "Slow down on the reforms, and seek compromise "
poland.4.c:0 "Abdication is preferable over a bloody revolt. (Abdicates)"
poland.5.t:0 "The Question of Succession"
poland.5.d:0 "The Polish Sejm is split over the question of a hereditary monarchy. Whilst some agree it is an excellent way for the Nobles to exercise power in the form of electing a king, others agree that the elective monarchy is prone to external meddling by rival powers such as Russia. Either way, the sejm remains split over the issue, and will not cave in to demands by Augustus."
poland.5.a:0 "We can always discuss it later, right? "
poland.5.b:0 "They surely can be bought."
poland.5.c:0 "Perhaps keeping the Royal guard around the Sejm will make the Szlachta change their minds."
poland.6.t:0 "Motion of Moderate Modernization"
poland.6.d:0 "Although many of the Szlachta are hesitant to the idea, some form of compromise was found surrounding Augustus’ plans to modernize the Polish political system which currently leaves Poland vulnerable both internally and externally. Although a broad and obscure motion might be agreed upon, it will likely not bring many changes in reality. The bill is however, symbolically importance for Augustus’s legitimacy which is at an all-time low."
poland.6.a:0 "The bill passes."
poland.6.b:0 "One of the Nobles issues his Veto."
poland.7.t:0 "Bill vetoed"
poland.7.d:0 "The Nobleman Rafał Leszczyński has called upon his privilege of Liberum veto, individually blocking the bill which seemingly was the only way out of this mess. With Augustus’ legitimacy on a silk thread, the options seem limited."
poland.7.a:0 "Take Leszczyński out of the picture!"
poland.8.t:0 "Outrage over Leszczyński"
poland.8.d:0 "Unfortunately the sudden disappearance of Rafał Leszczyński has sparked widespread suspicion amongst the magnates in the Sejm. It was not soon after that his body was discovered in a ditch. This scandal has outraged the Szlachta who are now feeling more threatened than ever. Not soon after a bill was passed through the Sejm, demanding the immediate abdication of Augustus on grounds of breaking the laws of the land."
poland.8.a:0 "Abdication was inevitable. (Abdicates)"
poland.9.t:0 "Treason"
poland.9.d:0 "As you drink from your cup of wine, a strange and unpleasant feeling goes through your belly. Odd, the Bordeaux wine is usually quite calming. “It must be something else that is upsetting my stomach”. Suddenly the Chef-Cook rushes out of the kitchen… “STOOOPP! DON’T DRINK IT! POISO....” At that moment the cook realizes it’s already too late, as do you as saliva is oozing out of your mouth and you eyes go dark. You have been poisoned.\n \nNow that the king has died, new elections will be called. Augustus’ successor will hopefully deal with the Szlachta in wise manner, or he will perhaps face the same fate. Either way, a warning has been given."
poland.9.a:0 "We will find a suitable replacement."
poland.10.t:0 "Nobles Revolt against Augustus"
poland.10.d:0 "Tired of being threatened both physically and politically by Augustus ‘the Strong’, an alliance of Poland’s most influential Nobles has come together and gathered an army to face Augustus’ military force. The battle is fierce and bloody but eventually…"
poland.10.a:0 "Augustus is captured and the Szlachta seize complete control over the nation."
poland.10.b:0 "The rebel army is defeated, but moments later Augusts succumbs to his wounds in battle."
poland.11.t:0 "The Commonwealth seeks to purchase minor border regions."
poland.11.d:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has requested that, as a sign of friendship,  we sell them the relatively worthless Polish-speaking border states of Zaolzie and Katowice. As of late, they have proven themselves to be a loyal friend and ally, and they now crave to be rewarded as such. Seeing the relative worth of the provinces, it might not be a terrible deal after all."
poland.11.a:0 "He is a relative, after all. (accept)"
poland.11.b:0 "Who does he think he is?! (refuse)"
poland.12.t:0 "Austria accepts our request"
poland.12.d:0 "The Austrian emperor has accepted our request to hand over Zaolzie and Katowice, celebrating the ties between our two great nations!"
poland.12.a:0 "Indeed, the foundation for a new alliance."
poland.13.t:0 "Austria refuses our request"
poland.13.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Austrian emperor has made a fierce misjudgement and has decided to refuse our fair proposal. It is clear, we do not have a strong friend in the south."
poland.13.a:0 "We should look for allies elsewhere."
poland.14.t:0 "Poland offers a non-agression pact in return for territories"
poland.14.d:0 "As Poland is assembling a new crusade against the Ottomans, they are seeking reassurance that we will not invade them from the east. In return they offer us the states of Gomel & Vitebsk. How shall we respond?"
poland.14.a:0 "They can be assured of our neutrality."
poland.14.b:0 "It is not in the national interest."
poland.15.t:0 "Russia accepts"
poland.15.d:0 "The Russian Czar has accepted our proposal of a non-agression pact. There shall be no war between our two countries."
poland.15.a:0 "Excellent news."
poland.16.t:0 "Russia refuses"
poland.16.d:0 "The Russian Czar has announced he will not enter in a formal treaty with Poland, stating it is not in their national interest. Mysterious message, indeed."
poland.16.a:0 "What are they planning?"
poland.17.t:0 "Invitation to the Anti-Ottoman Pact"
poland.17.d:0 "With the influence of the Ottoman Empire waning, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has proposed a pact that when war should exist between any catholic nation and the Ottoman Empire, all members of said pact would join to dismantle the Ottoman Empire permanently."
poland.17.a:0 "Yes, the infidels must be destroyed!"
poland.17.b:0 "No, crusades are part of the past."
poland.18.t:0 "Call to arms against Ottomans"
poland.19.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to join the pact."
poland.19.d:0 "The Cowardly nation, [From.GetName], has abandoned us and betrayed the anti-Otoman pact."
poland.19.a:0 "Traitors, of the Catholic faith."
poland.20.d:0 "[From.GetName] has honored the Anti-Ottoman pact. Soon their forces will join us in battle."
poland.20.a:0 "Good to hear."
poland.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] joins the Anti-Ottoman pact."
poland.21.t:0 "Call pact members to arms"
poland.21.d:0 "As we are in a war against the Ottomans, we should call upon the members of our pact!"
poland.21.a:0 "Let us hope they honor the pact."
poland.22.t:0 "Western guarantee for territories?"
poland.22.d:0 "With Russia mobilizing against us, we are vastly outnumbered and vulnerable on all sides. If we could secure a guarantee from the western powers however in return for some territories, we might be able to reclaim new lands in the east and devastate the enemy in the west."
poland.22.a:0 "Ask Prussia for a gurantee in return for Danzig and Poznan."
poland.22.b:0 "Ask Austria a guarantee in return for Galicia."
poland.22.c:0 "We need the help of both Prussia and Austria."
poland.22.e:0 "We don't need any allies!"
poland.23.t:0 "Poland offers territories for a guarantee"
poland.23.d:0 "The Polish nation has approached us with an interesting deal. They would be willing to give up the territories of Poznan, Danzig and Warmia, in return for a defensive alliance against Russia."
poland.23.a:0 "We accept!"
poland.23.b:0 "We should not antagonize Russia."
poland.24.t:0 "Poland offers territories for a guarantee"
poland.24.d:0 "The Polish nation has approached us with an interesting deal. They would be willing to give up the region of Galicia, in return for a defensive alliance against Russia."
poland.24.a:0 "We accept!"
poland.24.b:0 "We should not antagonize Russia."
poland.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts"
poland.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted to join our defensive alliance against Russia. We will seek strenght in numbers."
poland.25.a:0 "A relief."
poland.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses"
poland.26.d:0 "[From.GetName] has refused our deal. We stand alone."
poland.26.a:0 "Alone indeed."
poland.27.t:0 "Treaty of Karlowitz"
poland.27.d:0 "Following the signing of a peace treaty in Sremski Karlovci, the war between the Holy League and the Ottoman empire has officially come to a close. As we have valliantly participated in the war, we have also received some of the spoils of war and we finally see the return of the province of Podolia."
poland.28.t:0 "The Vulnerability of Sweden"
poland.28.d:0 "Following the treaty of Preobrazhenskoye signed between us, Russia, and Denmark, in which we have agreed to simultaneously attack Sweden, the oppurtunity has presented itself. As the Swedes start to suspect something, we should launch a suprise attack before they realise our intent and re-arm. As we and our allies vastly outnumber the Swedes, it should be a particulary easy victory. On top of that, the Commonwealth is in dire need of a military victory, for they may finally start rallying behind their one and true king."
poland.29.t:0 "Forming a government"
poland.29.d:0 "Poland is still a medieval state in a lot of ways. The way of governing is very unlike the French system of ministers and ministries. With the knowledge imported from France, we will build a rational admistration, with the purpose of reforming Poland in a modern state after the example of France. Their will be 5 key ministries: The ministry of domestic affairs, the ministry of finance, the ministry of foreign affairs, the ministry of war and the ministry of the navy.\n \nThere are many suitable candidates who have the favor of the king. Cardinal Michał Stefan Radziejowski, who had orginally proclaimed Conti as king of Poland all the way back in 1697, will be rewarded with the post of prime minister. Melchior de Polignac, a key figure in the election campaign of Conti shall be made minister of foreign affairs, whilst the famous Dutch privateer will become the head of the naval forces. Other posts are yet to be filled in, but these figures will certainly do a fine job at modernizing a state in dire need of a new direction."
poland.30.t:0 "Foreign Influence Weakens Administration"
poland.30.d:0 "A recent attempt of foreign ambassadors to further infiltrate our administrations and tighten their grip on our country has resulted in a loss of control over parts of government, damaging our nations ability to act on all sorts of political decisions."

POLITICS_FREDERICK_AUGUSTUS_DESC:0 "Augustus II the Strong, also known in Saxony as Frederick Augustus I, was Elector of Saxony from 1697, Imperial Vicar and elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in the since 1697. Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames "the Strong", "the Saxon Hercules" and "Iron-Hand". He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end. He is also notable for fathering a very large number of children. \n\nIn order to be elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece from the Holy Roman Emperor. As Elector of Saxony, he is perhaps best known as a patron of the arts and architecture. He established the Saxon capital of Dresden as a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw. \n\nIt is feared that his reign will bring troubling times to Poland-Lithuania. Altough he did not win the most votes in the Polish-Lithuanian election, he managed to claim the throne nonetheless with the help of Russia and Austria. It is now feared that his dependency on foreign powers will further deteriorate the political situation in Poland. As August attempts to establish an absolutist rule over Poland, the influence of Russia grows by the day. Now poland prepares on the eve of war against Sweden in a combined effort with the Russians and Danes."
