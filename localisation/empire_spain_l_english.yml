spain.5.t:0 "Spain seeks Papal Blessing"
spain.5.d:0 "With the succession of Philip V, Spain now asks of his holiness the pope to give his blessing to legitimize the newly ascended dynasty."
spain.5.a:0 "Of course, they shall have our blessing."
spain.5.b:0 "Denounce the coronation!"
spain.6.t:0 "Powerstruggle in the Spanish Court"
spain.6.d:0 "With the health of Charles II deteriorating, the actual power of the monarch came into the hands of powerful advisors in the court. The most influential of these people were Maria Anna, Charles' Wife, and cardinal Portocarrero, an ambitious clergyman.\n \nThe two regularly clash over Charles' will. Maria Anna is in favor of an Austrian succesor to the throne, whilst Portocarrero is strongly pro-Bourbon.\n \nWith Charles' health worsening, one of these advisors must be appointed as designated regent. Not an easy choice, as it may have a deep impact on future developments in Europe."
spain.6.a:0 "Stay loyal to Maria Anna"
spain.6.b:0 "Portocarrero has superiour knowledge of statesmanship!"
spain.7.t:0 "The Pope grants his blessing!"

spain.8.d:0 "Rather outrageously, the pope has decided to denounce our claims to the Spanish Realm, stating it would 'upset the balance of power in Europe'."
spain.8.a:0 "Who cares about the Pope's opinion these days, right?"
