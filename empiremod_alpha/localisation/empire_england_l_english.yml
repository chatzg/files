France received Naples, Sicily and the Spanish province of Gipuzkoa as well as the Duchy of Milan, which it would exchange for the Duchy of Lorraine. France would also transfer Naples and Sicily to Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy in exchange for the Counties of Nice and Savoy. \n\nNow it remains to be seen wether the Spanish king will ratify this treaty, or if diplomacy totally and utterly fails."

england.9.d:0 "After several months of rising tensions, supporters of the king have raised arms against parliament. This has kickstarted a civil war in which the monarchists want to restore the power of the king and dissolve parliament. It would almost seem as if history repeats itself."

English diplomats have however made convincing arguments that the French downfall is seemingly inevitable. On top of that, the French have offered us nothing for our contribution in the war so far, making it seem a pretty pointless conflict for our country. The English have promised, that if we open another front in the east of France, we shall be rewarded the valueable possession of Sicily.

mod.13.d:0 "For many months tension has been building up in England. It all started with the formation of the so called Second Long Parliament in opposition to William III of Orange, due to concerns over his succession and overall weak rule. As parliament made moves towards securing the state, monarchist elements took parallel measures. \n \nAn official state of civil war was officially declared after royalist troops unsuccessfully attacked the Westminster Parliament. Hostilities soon after broke out all around the country. Whilst the English are at war with one another, it is uncertain how the Irish and Scots will react to this internal strife."

mod.15.d:0 "Undoubtedly, many throughout Europe would question the insane motives of the peasant craze which has taken control over England. In an almost unbelievable way, they have now proclaimed that England shall henceforth be known as Utopia. Utopia is the name of a fantasy kingdom invented by Thomas More, who wanted to expose the hypocrisy of the elements of the Ancien Régime. \n \nWhilst More had intended for his work to become mere satire, the people of England have elevated More to the rank of a prophet, and Utopia as a holy scripture. Indeed, the populace of England has gone completely mad."

mod.17.t:0 "Hanoverian Succession"
mod.17.d:0 "As Queen Anne of England, Scotland and Ireland has entered in a royal marriage with duke George I of Hanover a union exists between the two states. Henceforth, England will take control over the foreign affairs of Hanover. \n \nWhilst the emperor is mostly indifferent toward the matter, the succession has mainly caused friction between England and Sweden, as the county and city of Bremen are considered rightful clay of Hanover."
mod.17.a:0 "Okay."
england.14.t:0 "Formation of the Long Parliament"
england.14.d:0 "As republican elements become more dominant in parliament, the king finds it more difficult to find a majority for his plans to centralize England and Scotland. In opposition to the king, a so called second Long Parliament has formed, in parallel to the situation in 1640 which led to the English Civil War. \n \nThis Long Parliament is determined to undermine the monarch’s authority. Now that parliament has practically seized control over the nation, another civil war is all but inevitable."
england.14.a:0 "Sounds bad."
