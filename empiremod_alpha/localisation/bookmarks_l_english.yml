 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 2 years since the establishment of an unstable peace in Europe after the exhausting 9 years war. This peace has proven to be merely a short truce, as Europe is once again preparing for the horros of war. In the North, a coalition of Danes, Poles and Russians is assembling against the young and inexperienced Swedish king Charles XII. In the West, the sickness of the childless Charles II threatens to disturb the balance of power in Europe, as he has appointed an heir of Louis XIV as his heir, threatening to establish an allmighty personal union between France and Spain. How will you lead your nation through this dark era? 
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Glorious Revolution in 1688, England has seen large economic growth thanks to a personal union with the Dutch, even though the revolution left deep scars. England is in a strong diplomatic position, finding many allies who wish to counter the Bourbon menace. Political uncertainty in Spain threatens to disturb the balance of power in Europe, as France once more seeks to expand. England must stand ready and intervene if necessary, for the balance of power cannot be disturbed!"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under the leadership of Louis XIV, ‘the Sun King’, France has firmly established itself as the dominant power in Europe. To keep France in check, the other European powers formed a ‘Grand Alliance’ to counter France. With the Habsburg line threatening to end in Spain, the time is ripe for the next change of Louis’ plan to dominate Europe. A puppet king in Spain, surely would make France unstoppable."
 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Dutch Republic’s independence from the Spanish they have been a dominant economic power in Europe. As a haven of tolerance, the Netherlands have attracted thinkers and artists from all over Europe, starting the Dutch Golden Era. In 1688 finally came an end to the Anglo-Dutch rivalry after the establishment of a personal union under William of Orange. The French threat however has put a strain on the budget, and the military expenses are far greater than the income. Will the Republic continue to the decline, or will a second Golden Era save the nation?"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The still ongoing war with the Ottoman empire, has firmly established Austria as the dominant power in central Europe. Now that Hungary has returned to the empire, it is time to seek peace so that Austria can focus on the upcoming crisis in Western Europe, for the balance of power is at stake. Although a Habsburg candidate is in place to succeed the Spanish king, the Bourbons seek to establish a candidate of their own. Will you solve this crisis through diplomacy, or shall you go to war?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the 30 years war, Sweden has know a golden era and exceptional rulers. They managed to field an impressive army and built a dominant empire in Northern Europe, encompassing most of the Baltic. On this path to greatness however, they have made many enemies. Now that a young and unexperienced king, Charles XII, sits upon the throne, the enemies of Sweden sense weakness. Russians to the east, Danes to the west and Poles to the south. Preparations must be made, for war is coming."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under Peter I, Russia has seen unprecedented growth. Previously a backwater, Peters reforms have started a modernization of Russia firmly establishing the nation as a European great power. The Streltsy revolt in 1698 has reversed many of these reforms however. A new opportunity might help to strengthen our position. Our rival Sweden is ruled by a weak and inexperienced king, and their enemies are many. If we are to establish ourselves as a dominant power in Europe, we must crush them"
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Spanish Empire was the dominant power in Europe up to the 17th century when hyperinflation and constant wars with France caused a steep decline. Entering the 18th century, the empire is in crisis. Bankruptcy has grinded to economy to a standstill, and the faltering health of the heirless Habsburg king threatens to spark a succession crisis which will bring war to Europe once more."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania has been in a state of near constant warfare for decades. Its population has been devasted by war, weakening the commonwealth’s position. Poland sits at a precarious geographic position, occupying a largely flat plain between the Habsburg empire, Russia, and the rising power Prussia. A newly elected king, Augustus Frederick, now seeks to reform the elective monarchy to put an end to the meddling of foreign power and to restore Poland-Lithuania’s former greatness. He is however expected to experience great resistance by has many rivals."
 PRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Prince-electorate of Brandenburg Prussia is seen as a rising regional power. Since the inheritance of Prussia in 1618 the Margraviate of Brandenburg has managed to expand its boundaries through cunning diplomacy and an effective military force. The upcoming conflicts in Europe are a test for Brandenburg-Prussia: Will they make a difference, and firmly establish themselves as a major European power."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Great Turkish war between the Ottomans and Austrians draws to a close, the Ottomans are left defeated. Decades of weak leadership and a disastrous military campaign have left the Ottoman empire on the verge of collapse. On top of that, the increasingly powerfull janissaries are on the brink of revolting. Will you restore the Ottoman greatness, or will you be the last Khalifa?"
 SAV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The great nation of Savoy is regarded as a minor power by the major powers of Europe. However its strategic position in Northern Italy is viewed as vital by both the French and the Austrians. As the Savoyards have managed to keep good relations with the great powers, they can play both. However, Vittorio Amedeo should be careful, as becoming to ambitious might spell Savoy's downfall."
