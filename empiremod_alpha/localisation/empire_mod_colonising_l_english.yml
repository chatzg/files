 Colonisation.7.desc:0 "The Empire Mod has got a colonisation feature, to be able to colonise you need to first unlock the technology for it. Some nations already have some technology unlocked at the start of the game. The major colonial powers at this time, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have got a boost in Colonisation Tech. If you have completed the tech for the continent you want to colonise, you need 50 political power and 10000 manpower, then you press on the state you want to colonise and a gui with one button apears, you press on the button to colonise, then a mission starts for 150 days if you haven't done the 'More Colonies' tech. At the end of the mission there's a 50 50 chance for it to fail or succeed, this can be modified by different modifiers: If the state isn't coastal the chance of it failing doubles. If it is wasteland then the chance of it failing gets multiplied by 10 , and the chance of it suceeding can also be modified by tech."
